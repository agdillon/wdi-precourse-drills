  <h1>Why Am I Here?</h1>

<p>I decided to do the Galvanize Web Dev program after attending some of the
Learn to Code sessions.  I've enjoyed coding since I was a kid, but
(for some reason) I never focused on it until now.  Now that we've started the
program, I feel lucky that what I'm "supposed to" be doing with my time is what
I like to do anyway.  It will be even better when I'm getting paid for it.</p>

<p>I'm not much of a designer, but I love logic and fixing things, so I think
I might want to do back-end development.  I'm looking forward to having
more varied and challenging work, and making enough money so I can travel a
little while I'm still young.</p>
