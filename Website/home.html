<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Amanda.  I moved to Boulder in January with my partner Jason.  We
came from Naples, Florida where I had lived most of my life.  We have three
cats, Tonks, Gaston, and Nikita.  I like puzzles, trivia, thrift shopping,
reading, and listening to music.  I'd like to do more outdoor activities now
that we're in Colorado, but I don't know where to start.</p>

I have very few pictures of myself, but a lot of pictures of my cats.</div>
